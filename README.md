Pretty much all of the info on this site is from the wikipedia pages on the Halo games. The site was originaly created on code.org but you can view it here: https://codeprojects.org/projects/weblab/vkAoKIWxnPO-4ZVIuqANKQcO7qZFCPHmA3yTVe06dEY I wanted to recreate it as an actual website just so I could prove to myself that I COULD create site. I am not at all a proffesional and I probbablye have some spelling mistakes in here somewhere. Don't sue me thanks for viewing. This is v2 of the site.
